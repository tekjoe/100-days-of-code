# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Pushed portfolio site to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts:** Uploading a website to GitHub pages was extremely easy and I can see myself using it as a staging area for personal projects in the future. With this site, I learned about the CSS property `overflow`and how it can be used to add scrolling to HTML elements.

### Day 1: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Used create-react-app and practiced passing props around to components. Used the OpenWeather API to request local weather and saved the results to state.

**Thoughts:** I'm still trying to understand React and how to pass props down to components but I made a little bit of progress today. I was able to get the local weather data, save it to state, then pass it down as props to a component. Moving foward, I'd like to understand how I can make an API call to something like Twitter or Fitbit that require authentication before returning any results.
