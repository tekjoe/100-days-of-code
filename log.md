# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Pushed portfolio site to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts:** Uploading a website to GitHub pages was extremely easy and I can see myself using it as a staging area for personal projects in the future. With this site, I learned about the CSS property `overflow`and how it can be used to add scrolling to HTML elements.
